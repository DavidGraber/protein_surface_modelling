# Protein Molecular Surface Fingerprinting on Mutants of GB1 protein

Repository containing code for molecular surface fingerprinting and prediction of protein interaction. The interaction of protein G subunit B1 and human IgG constant region is taken as an example here. The interaction of the WT GB1 protein with IgG is examined closely and a radial
